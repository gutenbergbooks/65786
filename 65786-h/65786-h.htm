<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><p class="drop-cap">A HOUSE and a barn on an acre of ground&mdash;</p></div>
<div class="verse">And there wasn&#8217;t another of either around</div>
<div class="verse">Save the houses afloat that went flying apast,</div>
<div class="verse">For the waters had closed all around them at last.</div>
<div class="verse">There the dancers had come on the ev&#8217;ning before</div>
<div class="verse">In their high-seated wagon&mdash;a full score or more,</div>
<div class="verse">With fiddlers and one they called &#8220;Oracle,&#8221; who</div>
<div class="verse">Was a modern Sebastian Cerezo, and knew</div>
<div class="verse">(About dancing and things) more than any one &#8217;round</div>
<div class="verse">In the house or the barn on the acre of ground.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8217;Twas at the great bend near the town of Dinwiddie</div>
<div class="verse">On the banks of the river Ohio, and giddy,</div>
<div class="verse">The gay, dizzy dance, like a far-away echo,</div>
<div class="verse">Seems laughing to me of a time long ago,</div>
<div class="verse">In the merry round waltz and the songs for the reels,</div>
<div class="verse">In the &#8220;Oracle&#8217;s&#8221; rhymes that were slicker than eels,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
<div class="verse">And the snug little town whence the dancers had come</div>
<div class="verse">On the evening before to the old country home,</div>
<div class="verse">Is as fresh to my mind as the tall trees around</div>
<div class="verse">The frame house and the barn on the acre of ground.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">There the tall trees are standing, still standing alone</div>
<div class="verse">Like sentinels now, and are now taller grown,</div>
<div class="verse">Where once was the homestead. How often I&#8217;m told</div>
<div class="verse">By the boatmen who traveled the river of old,</div>
<div class="verse">That they never can pass round the great sweeping bend</div>
<div class="verse">But the dance is recalled, and they think of the end</div>
<div class="verse">That so suddenly came to the cherished old place;</div>
<div class="verse">They note the tall trees as its last lingering trace&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Their long branches waving as if in a trance</div>
<div class="verse">From a waltz they had caught on the night of the dance.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">There often the town folks, still curious, stray</div>
<div class="verse">To look o&#8217;er the place on a summery day,</div>
<div class="verse">Recounting the story when nearing the sight,</div>
<div class="verse">And some one will tell of the dance of that night,</div>
<div class="verse">Of the dancers who came there that evening before&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Not thinking the river could rise any more&mdash;</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
<div class="verse">Will sing the reel songs and will point to the place</div>
<div class="verse">Where once stood the house on that now crumbling base</div>
<div class="verse">When caught in the flood on that night without warning</div>
<div class="verse">To the dancers within till the dawn of the morning.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8217;Twas a house of firm structure, but fashioned quite plain,</div>
<div class="verse">With its hallway, its rooms and a roof &#8217;gainst the rain,</div>
<div class="verse">With a story below and a story above,</div>
<div class="verse">And the rooms were all ample and wide; but the love</div>
<div class="verse">For the house was of measure far more than its worth.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8217;Twas the mem&#8217;ries that ever recurred for its hearth</div>
<div class="verse">That made it so precious. I love to recall</div>
<div class="verse">The long row of windows, the doorway and hall,</div>
<div class="verse">And fondly thought lingers&mdash;in fancy I see</div>
<div class="verse">The trees that seem nodding and laughing to me.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The farm swept the valley to right and to left</div>
<div class="verse">For a mile to the hill where the quarry was cleft.</div>
<div class="verse">From the house to the hill it was level and low,</div>
<div class="verse">And oft in the spring-time the flood-tide would grow</div>
<div class="verse">Till the back-waters covered the fields at their will,</div>
<div class="verse">But they lay there as peaceful and placid and still</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
<div class="verse">As the mountain lakes seem, then, as if in a dream,</div>
<div class="verse">They would gently recede as they followed the stream;</div>
<div class="verse">And the house and the barn that were built on a mound</div>
<div class="verse">Overlooked the great river and all of the ground.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8217;Twas Twilleger&#8217;s farm. It was Twilleger&#8217;s way</div>
<div class="verse">To give a big dance and be joyous and gay</div>
<div class="verse">In the early spring season. It did his soul good</div>
<div class="verse">To gather around him the whole neighborhood;</div>
<div class="verse">For Twilley (they called him) had ways of his own,</div>
<div class="verse">And except a few servants, he lived quite alone.</div>
<div class="verse">In the early spring season, when cider grows harder,</div>
<div class="verse">He would stock up his cellar and also his larder,</div>
<div class="verse">And then would invite the gay dancers to come</div>
<div class="verse">From out of the town to the old country home.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">For a week, ere the night of the dance, a high tide</div>
<div class="verse">Of water had covered the farm to the side</div>
<div class="verse">Of a road running out from the house to the hill.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8217;Twas receding, they said&mdash;it was even and still.</div>
<div class="verse">Yet the sky had been sullen and surcharged with rain,</div>
<div class="verse">And there was an unrest at the threatening gain</div>
<div class="verse">Of the waters that leaped o&#8217;er the banks at the shore</div>
<div class="verse">To a point that was higher than known of before,</div>
<div class="verse">For the early spring thaw of the deep-lying snow</div>
<div class="verse">In the mountains augmented the high overflow.</div>
</div></div></div>



<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/fp_08.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">They were coming, were coming.</p>



<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
<div class="verse">But the clear sky it left when the sun had declined</div>
<div class="verse">On the eve of the dance reassured every mind.</div>
<div class="verse">How balmy and sweet was the evening! How fair</div>
<div class="verse">Was the face of all nature that smiled everywhere!</div>
<div class="verse">Far out on the highway their voices rang clear</div>
<div class="verse">As the dancers were coming with song and a cheer</div>
<div class="verse">In their wagon that rumbled along with its load.</div>
<div class="verse">They were coming, were coming far down on the road,</div>
<div class="verse">And to meet them, away ran the great baying hound</div>
<div class="verse">To lead them down home to the acre of ground.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">There the dancers were welcomed by Twilley soon after,</div>
<div class="verse">Where they filled all the rooms with a chatter and laughter.</div>
<div class="verse">Their sparkling bright eyes showed their fine healthy thriving,</div>
<div class="verse">And joyous and mirthful, their wits were soon striving,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
<div class="verse">And many sly banters and rail&#8217;ries were given</div>
<div class="verse">To lovers, that were in turn back again driven,</div>
<div class="verse">For some of them loved to be told of their love,</div>
<div class="verse">Whilst others were shy and as mild as a dove,</div>
<div class="verse">And just as soft-cooing&mdash;to some there&#8217;s a pleasure</div>
<div class="verse">In hiding their love as the birds hide their treasure.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Now most of the women who came from the town</div>
<div class="verse">Were sweetly suburban in manner and gown,</div>
<div class="verse">Though none the less merry or jauntily gay,</div>
<div class="verse">Whilst some were profuse in a brilliant display.</div>
<div class="verse">Selina! Selina was there! Were there ever</div>
<div class="verse">Such eyes as Selina&#8217;s? No wonder the river</div>
<div class="verse">Crept higher and higher to bask in the light</div>
<div class="verse">Of her dark, rolling eyes. No wonder that night</div>
<div class="verse">That the stars faded fast and from envy withdrew,</div>
<div class="verse">For her eyes were far brighter&mdash;they every one knew.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Ah, the runaway laugh of Louisa still rings</div>
<div class="verse">Like a merry and lingering echo. It brings</div>
<div class="verse">Recollections of pink-glowing cheeks, and a girl</div>
<div class="verse">Whose fun-loving spell set the house in a whirl,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
<div class="verse">As her laughter ran riot and touched everywhere,</div>
<div class="verse">Till Amanda, the chaperon, with dignified air</div>
<div class="verse">And a fine, arching brow, was compelled to unbend</div>
<div class="verse">And to follow the frivolous, frolicsome trend</div>
<div class="verse">Of a something she knew not&mdash;she wasn&#8217;t half sure</div>
<div class="verse">If she laughed with Louisa or just at her laughter.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But &#8217;tis needless to point all their feminine graces,</div>
<div class="verse">Or with blund&#8217;ring endeavor to profile their faces,</div>
<div class="verse">For every one knows where the prodigal nature</div>
<div class="verse">Once lavished the rarest of all of her treasure;</div>
<div class="verse">Where she hung the steep hill in a moment of leisure,</div>
<div class="verse">And dreamed the sweet valleys with lingering pleasure;</div>
<div class="verse">She smiled, and the streamlets will run there forever</div>
<div class="verse">And yield their full measure to form the great river;</div>
<div class="verse">But how void were the hills and the valleys and waters,</div>
<div class="verse">Till she brought there the fairest of all of her daughters.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">All the beauties were there from the strath-haven town,</div>
<div class="verse">And some were so queenly they lacked but the crown;</div>
<div class="verse">And the men, while of no very special great talent,</div>
<div class="verse">There was yet a lieutenant with airs that were gallant.</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
<div class="verse">There was also a wit who was quite proud of it,</div>
<div class="verse">Who teased an old bachelor&mdash;not sociable a bit,</div>
<div class="verse">For love so absorbed him he smiled and was mute,</div>
<div class="verse">While Malinda just laughed and encouraged his suit,</div>
<div class="verse">Till the heart of the bachelor grew light as a feather,</div>
<div class="verse">And he and Malinda drew closer together.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And even the cynical Simon was won</div>
<div class="verse">As the chatter of dancers went merrily on,</div>
<div class="verse">Till once he laughed loudly and ever so jolly&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">&#8217;Twas all on account of the popular Polly.</div>
<div class="verse">Tim Dolor, the bashful, was quite at his ease,</div>
<div class="verse">And every one there seemed as easy to please,</div>
<div class="verse">And every face beamed with a broadening smile</div>
<div class="verse">That broke into ripples of laughter the while,</div>
<div class="verse">As the men chose their partners some time in advance</div>
<div class="verse">Of the fiddles that had to be tuned for the dance.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Ah, the little sly glances that gave the love-token,</div>
<div class="verse">The soft-whispered words by the fond lovers spoken.</div>
<div class="verse">Whilst some were coquetting by way of diversion,</div>
<div class="verse">There were others inclined to an earnest assertion,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
<div class="verse">As around through the rooms and the halls they would ramble;</div>
<div class="verse">The Bold Roland Rare in a light-footed amble,</div>
<div class="verse">With an air of a fine condescending compassion,</div>
<div class="verse">Gave the latest new step that had come into fashion;</div>
<div class="verse">And some fell to giving and guessing new riddles</div>
<div class="verse">While the fumbling old fiddlers were fixing their fiddles.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Twice, thrice, had the band leader sprung to his feet</div>
<div class="verse">To call for attention, while deftly he beat</div>
<div class="verse">On the back of his fiddle, then drew a swift bow</div>
<div class="verse">&#8217;Crost its sensitive strings that the players might know</div>
<div class="verse">&#8217;Twas time to begin, but a fiddle-string snapped</div>
<div class="verse">And put things awry every time that he rapped;</div>
<div class="verse">Then tuning and strumming would vie with the horn</div>
<div class="verse">That was screeching a monotone strange and forlorn,</div>
<div class="verse">While Cupid accepted the timely delay</div>
<div class="verse">To lead the fond lovers aside and away.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And meanwhile the &#8220;Oracle&#8221; wrote some new rhymes</div>
<div class="verse">For the dances. Said he, &#8220;I write better at times.</div>
<div class="verse">My old rhymes were good, to be sure, some were fine,</div>
<div class="verse">Very fine&mdash;you could hardly find fault with a line.</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
<div class="verse">On occasions like this, I write new ones,&#8221; said he,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;For everything here is inspiring to me.</div>
<div class="verse">I can write of the things that I see on the spot,</div>
<div class="verse">And the dancers will notice that when I take thought,</div>
<div class="verse">I just leap upon Pegasus, speed him along,</div>
<div class="verse">Till my fancies go rhyming and turn to a song.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;I&#8217;m a very great poet, as every one knows.</div>
<div class="verse">See how dreamy I look, and how long my hair grows.</div>
<div class="verse">I talk in a rhythm that&#8217;s classical, too.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8217;Twere a marvel to tell all the things I can do.</div>
<div class="verse">I can dance every jig of the day or tradition,</div>
<div class="verse">But while dancing alone is my greatest ambition,</div>
<div class="verse">I often indulge in the light recreation</div>
<div class="verse">Of keeping the river at just its right station,</div>
<div class="verse">So that floods at Dinwiddie occasion no worry&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">I have them subside when they get o&#8217;er their flurry.&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8217;Twas a story oft told, though it hardly deceived,</div>
<div class="verse">That the &#8220;Oracle&#8221; could&mdash;which he doubtless believed&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Make the rising Ohio floods quickly subside</div>
<div class="verse">When he stretched forth his hand and commanded the tide.</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
<div class="verse">&#8217;Twas a great feat of magic, and if he seemed vain,</div>
<div class="verse">His pride was forgiven again and again,</div>
<div class="verse">For as often as flood-waters threatened the town,</div>
<div class="verse">It was well understood why the tide had gone down;</div>

<div class="verse">When I was young I often heard</div>
<div class="indent">There was no sign or token</div>

<div class="verse">And yet it seemed that very day</div>
<div class="indent">I found my heart relenting,</div>
<div class="verse">But he was gone, Oh, gone away!</div>
<div class="indent">And I was left repenting.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">So, often now there comes a day</div>

<div class="verse">As though it all were true! It isn&#8217;t fair;</div>
<div class="verse">But let them talk, I&#8217;m sure I do not care.</div>
<div class="verse">Why, as I passed the store I looked away</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Now let me see. &#8217;Tis about a month or so</div>

<div class="verse">I didn&#8217;t say a word to him that night</div>
<div class="verse">Of what I&#8217;d heard, but acted gay and light,</div>
<div class="verse">And wasn&#8217;t jealous, either&mdash;not a bit,</div>
<div class="verse">Not the least, little tiny speck of it.</div>
<div class="verse">I talked and laughed, but as he went away</div>
<div class="verse">I said, &#8220;You&#8217;ll get a letter, Alfred Gray.&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And that was all I said, except, of course, &#8220;Good-bye,&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">But after he was gone&mdash;I don&#8217;t know why&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">I angry grew and wrote that letter then.</div>
<div class="verse">I told him what I thought of all the men,</div>
<div class="verse">And &#8217;bout him calling on my Cousin Kate;</div>
<div class="verse">Said I, &#8220;It isn&#8217;t jealousy, but hate,</div>
<div class="verse">That prompts me now to write to you this way,</div>
<div class="verse">So cease your calling on me, Alfred Gray.&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
<div class="verse">Next morn I sent the letter off to town,</div>
<div class="verse">And Cousin Kate, she heard how I&#8217;d gone down</div>
<div class="verse">And how I&#8217;d begged the postal clerk in vain</div>
<div class="verse">For him to give the letter back again;</div>
<div class="verse">Of course, it was a silly thing in me,</div>
<div class="verse">But then it really looked like jealousy,</div>
<div class="verse">And worried me to think of it that way&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Not that I cared at all for Alfred Gray.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And when my Cousin Kate came round to call,</div>
<div class="verse">She sat up straight, and prim, and proud, and tall,</div>

<div class="verse">As after while she bluntly asked me why</div>
<div class="verse">I worried &#8217;bout that letter I had sent.</div>

<div class="verse">Burst forth; I said in my <i>severest</i> way,</div>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Kate frowned at first, and then she laughed outright,</div>
<div class="verse">And said that maybe she could throw some light</div>
<div class="verse">Upon the mystery that troubled so.</div>
<div class="verse">A friend of hers she said, not long ago,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
<div class="verse">Who looked like Alfred, came to call on her&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">He looked like Alfred, only handsomer,</div>

<div class="verse">They took the handsome man for Alfred Gray.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Then Kate pretended dignity</div>
<div class="verse">And wounded feelings, too, and teasing me,</div>
<div class="verse">She said, it hurt her&mdash;what I said&mdash;and sighed,</div>
<div class="verse">Till both began to laugh&mdash;and then I cried,</div>
<div class="verse">For though I knew Kate told the truth to me,</div>
<div class="verse">It added still to my perplexity</div>
<div class="verse">If I should then attempt to tell the way</div>
<div class="verse">It all had come about to Alfred Gray.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I felt so &#8217;shamed in writing Alfred, then</div>
<div class="verse">And he&#8217;s so stubborn, too, like most the men,</div>
<div class="verse">He hasn&#8217;t written me a line as yet.</div>
<div class="verse">I maybe do sometimes a little fret,</div>
<div class="verse">And maybe, though it does seem very bold,</div>
<div class="verse">(You must not tell, or else I&#8217;ll know who told)</div>

<div class="verse">I&#8217;ve yielded to a drowsy sleep,</div>
<div class="verse">Unmindful that the sun was low,</div>
<div class="verse">When nature&#8217;s own sweet lullaby</div>
<div class="verse">Came soothingly to me.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Sweet eventide of long ago,</div>
<div class="verse">When swallows circled near the barn</div>
<div class="verse">And peacocks called their false forlorn;</div>
<div class="verse">When over at the dusky row</div>
<div class="verse">Was heard the darkies&#8217; jamboree,</div>
<div class="verse">In weird and unchecked rhapsody;</div>
<div class="verse">Far down the milky way would bow&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">&#8217;Twas night and full of witchery</div>
<div class="verse">In boyhood days to me.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I&#8217;m thinking of sweet Shenandoah</div>
<div class="verse">And days before the Civil Strife&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">I loved the old Virginia life,</div>
<div class="verse">The joyous days of long ago</div>
<div class="verse">When all the world to us we knew</div>
<div class="verse">Was there; when tears and laughter, too,</div>
<div class="verse">Were shared by all; if tears should flow</div>
<div class="verse">&#8217;Twas common cause for sympathy;</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
<div class="verse">To laugh was to intensify</div>
<div class="verse">The cause of laughter so. I grow</div>
<div class="verse">To fondly love the memory</div>
<div class="verse">That now comes back to me.</div>

<h3>IN THE ANTE-DELUVIAN DAY</h3>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">There once was a maid by the name of Mespay,</div>
<div class="verse">Who believed in the luck of a leisurely way;</div>
<div class="verse">At ninety, &#8217;twas noticed (to tell the whole truth)</div>
<div class="verse">She yet had neglected selecting a youth,</div>
<div class="verse">Though many had wooed the young maiden, they say,</div>
<div class="verse">In the Ante-Deluvian Day.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
<div class="verse">&#8217;Tis a matter of record the Chinese had kept&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">At which there are none who have been so adept&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">That Jabel had journeyed some hundreds of miles</div>
<div class="verse">With a herd of slick cattle to win the maid&#8217;s smiles,</div>
<div class="verse">When she took the whole herd, but she turned him away,</div>
<div class="verse">In the Ante-Deluvian Day.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Then Jubel came playing a harp made of gold,</div>
<div class="verse">Which he gave the fair maiden a moment to hold,</div>
<div class="verse">And leaving, he felt it would be a great wrong</div>
<div class="verse">If he then would ungallantly take it along,</div>
<div class="verse">Still, for one hundred years he remembered, they say,</div>
<div class="verse">The maid with the leisurely way.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Then Magella presented the Mount of Tusong,</div>
<div class="verse">And Jaered gave the maiden the valley of Hong,</div>
<div class="verse">And ev&#8217;ry unmarried man sought the maid&#8217;s hand,</div>
<div class="verse">Until she grew rich in both cattle and land,</div>
<div class="verse">For she twenty years longer turned lovers away,</div>
<div class="verse">In the Ante-Deluvian Day.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
<div class="verse">But when Noah appeared, and &#8217;twas well understood</div>
<div class="verse">He was building an ark, as he looked for a flood,</div>
<div class="verse">She married him when, at one hundred and ten,</div>
<div class="verse">She still felt too young to be marrying then,</div>
<div class="verse">But she did it to prove, as the Chinese will say,</div>
<div class="verse">There is luck in the leisurely way.</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The fiddles were heard and they turned to the dance</div>
<div class="verse">As though ev&#8217;ry one there had awaited the chance</div>
<div class="verse">To be first on the floor for the old waltz quadrille,</div>
<div class="verse">Which they never had danced but it brought a new thrill.</div>
<div class="verse">They glided and whirled with a giddy, gay swing,</div>
<div class="verse">Nor thought of the morrow nor what it would bring,</div>
<div class="verse">For midnight was only a part of the night,</div>
<div class="verse">While the night was all theirs till the morn&#8217;s early light;</div>
<div class="verse">All they cared for was there, and so why should they borrow</div>
<div class="verse">The shadow of thought for the coming to-morrow?</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Thus, thoughtless of danger and heedless of warning</div>
<div class="verse">The dancing went on till the dawn of the morning,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
<div class="verse">When in terror the dancers then found that the flood</div>
<div class="verse">Had surrounded the house and the barn, and they stood</div>
<div class="verse">On an island alone in the midst of the stream.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8217;Twas as if they had waked from a long, pleasing dream</div>
<div class="verse">To a fate that was ugly and stern, and appalled</div>
<div class="verse">At impending destruction, they frantic&#8217;ly called;</div>
<div class="verse">Some cried for a father, and some for a brother,</div>
<div class="verse">And screaming they ran from one side to the other.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And if, for a moment, their fears would subside,</div>
<div class="verse">Their terror returned as they watched the high tide,</div>
<div class="verse">For the river seemed angry that swept o&#8217;er the highways,</div>
<div class="verse">And madly it rushed o&#8217;er the country and byways,</div>
<div class="verse">As with threats of destruction it held its mane high</div>
<div class="verse">Like a monster that brooks no obstructions that lie</div>
<div class="verse">In its way, while it lashed with its tail at the shore;</div>
<div class="verse">Over country and highway, apast them it tore</div>
<div class="verse">With a swirl and a whirl as the high waves would break</div>
<div class="verse">To dash on the island a yellowish flake.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Since the Red Men had named it &#8220;the beautiful river,&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">No flood-tide was like it, nor yet was there ever</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
<div class="verse">Such woe on the fair verdant banks at its shore,</div>
<div class="verse">As higher and onward the great torrent bore,</div>
<div class="verse">As downward and forward the avalanche tore.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8217;Twas as wide as the valley from hill unto hill,</div>
<div class="verse">And as deep as the valley with turmoil to fill;</div>
<div class="verse">It bent the great oak standing upright and bold;</div>
<div class="verse">It swept away houses, the new with the old,</div>
<div class="verse">And together the hut and the mansion were rolled.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Oh! often the &#8220;Oracle&#8221; gave his command</div>
<div class="verse">In a grand, sweeping wave with his lily-white hand;</div>
<div class="verse">But the flood only laughed at the magical wand;</div>
<div class="verse">And strange now to say, but the dancers did hope</div>
<div class="verse">That somewhere a power was in it to cope</div>
<div class="verse">&#8217;Gainst the flood. They were ready to catch at a straw,</div>
<div class="verse">For drowning ones know neither reason nor law,</div>
<div class="verse">And to that which they ridiculed many a day</div>
<div class="verse">They anxiously turned in their fear and dismay,</div>
<div class="verse">Half trusting by that their destruction to stay.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">We may laugh at all creeds, and discredit tradition,</div>
<div class="verse">But danger discovers our blind superstition.</div>
<div class="verse">When our bodies are sick and we lie on our backs,</div>
<div class="verse">If we can not find doctors we send for the quacks;</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
<div class="verse">And if one should grow worse, there is no use denying</div>
<div class="verse">That the priest whom he scoffed at he wants when he&#8217;s dying;</div>
<div class="verse">In the absence of doctors or priests or of creeds,</div>
<div class="verse">We then turn to conjure with magical deeds.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8217;Twas the same with the dancers&mdash;they wanted to live,</div>
<div class="verse">And were ready to take what the faker could give.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8217;Twas a pitiful sight and a helpless appeal,</div>
<div class="verse">For the dancers&#8217; dilemma was awful and real.</div>
<div class="verse">Though the stronger among them their fears would conceal,</div>
<div class="verse">Still, their actions would show the forebodings they&#8217;d feel.</div>
<div class="verse">There was motive enough, there was courage; in fact,</div>
<div class="verse">They were anxious to dare, but were helpless to act.</div>
<div class="verse">Ah! some would have risked there the watery grave</div>
<div class="verse">If assured that their sweethearts by that they could save;</div>
<div class="verse">The occasion, the time, and the motive were there,</div>
<div class="verse">Had they only known how, they were ready to dare.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
<div class="verse">While the daring was there, still the river was wide,</div>
<div class="verse">And an effort to rescue seemed useless if tried;</div>
<div class="verse">So they talked and they planned with their heads close together;</div>
<div class="verse">They looked at the river and also the weather,</div>
<div class="verse">And the lovers were gathered real close to each other&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">For the loud-roaring river their voices would smother&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">And if still not so happy, they knew in each breast</div>
<div class="verse">Was a feeling far deeper than either had guessed;</div>
<div class="verse">But the river was wild, Oh! so wild and distracting,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8217;Twas hard to tell love from hysterical acting.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">From the house to the barn and returning again,</div>
<div class="verse">They wandered about till they came to the lane</div>
<div class="verse">That led past the house, and uneasily ever,</div>
<div class="verse">Retracing their footsteps, they watched the wild river;</div>
<div class="verse">They saw the fixed marks they had set as a gauge</div>
<div class="verse">Disappear in the flood as it reached to that stage;</div>
<div class="verse">They saw a house floating apast them at last,</div>
<div class="verse">They heard a child scream in the house as it passed!</div>
<div class="verse">Amazed and bewildered, they sought ev&#8217;rywhere</div>
<div class="verse">To escape from the peril that threatened them there.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
<div class="verse">But neither a boat nor a skiff was at hand</div>
<div class="verse">Which they felt had the strength &#8217;gainst the waves to withstand,</div>
<div class="verse">Save an old, dinky john-boat, and it wasn&#8217;t fit,</div>
<div class="verse">Yet Dan, the bass-fiddler, went rowing in it</div>
<div class="verse">To see, so he said, if the john-boat would do,</div>
<div class="verse">When out in the current the dinky boat flew,</div>
<div class="verse">And the fiddler was helpless and had to go, too.</div>
<div class="verse">They saw with alarm that his danger still grew</div>
<div class="verse">As the boat on an end like a bobble was toss&#8217;d,</div>
<div class="verse">Then plunged to a depth where it seemed to be lost.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">There breathless they stood in an agonized fear</div>
<div class="verse">When they saw him ride high to again disappear;</div>
<div class="verse">But bravely he fought with the oars at his side,</div>
<div class="verse">Though his efforts were futile to stem the high tide;</div>
<div class="verse">They saw the boat whirl in an eddy away,</div>
<div class="verse">Till it seemed he ceased striving in utter dismay;</div>
<div class="verse">Then the dancers seemed paralyzed there on the place,</div>
<div class="verse">And horror was stamped upon ev&#8217;ry pale face;</div>
<div class="verse">They heard his wild cries and it filled them with gloom,</div>
<div class="verse">He went from their view, and they thought to his doom.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
<div class="verse">They stood there in terror and thought of his fate.</div>
<div class="verse">It redoubled the fear of their own trying state,</div>
<div class="verse">And the ghost of poor Dan seemed to everywhere walk</div>
<div class="verse">In their midst&mdash;they were dazed and unable to talk;</div>
<div class="verse">For many were there who in life had seen naught</div>
<div class="verse">Of the horrors like that which that day to them brought,</div>
<div class="verse">And now when they realized all that had come,</div>
<div class="verse">They cried, Oh! they screamed for the loved ones at home,</div>
<div class="verse">But their voices were drowned in the maddening roar</div>
<div class="verse">And their tears dimmed the view of the far distant shore.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">We shrink from imprisonment ever afar;</div>
<div class="verse">We fight against water, the wall, or the bar</div>
<div class="verse">That would keep us from freedom to do as we will;</div>
<div class="verse">Even lovers or comrades together are still,</div>
<div class="verse">Never nearly so happy when liberty&#8217;s gone;</div>
<div class="verse">So they brought up the wine&mdash;something had to be done&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">And all the men drank it to steady their nerve,</div>
<div class="verse">For Twilley had told them that wine would preserve</div>
<div class="verse">The courage of man where there&#8217;s danger to face,</div>
<div class="verse">And the women all ate, as they cried &#8217;round the place.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
<div class="verse">For women eat more when they feel they&#8217;re in trouble,</div>
<div class="verse">And men not so much, but they drink about double.</div>
<div class="verse">True, &#8217;tis better in flood times to keep duly sober,</div>
<div class="verse">Like Noah of old did&mdash;the flood was all over</div>
<div class="verse">When he was so drunken&mdash;for he understood</div>
<div class="verse">(After being forewarned) how to handle a flood,</div>
<div class="verse">While the dancers lacked wisdom to know what to do,</div>
<div class="verse">For the strange situation was awkward and new;</div>
<div class="verse">But if they seemed foolish and often uncouth,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8217;Twas still but the weakness and folly of youth.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Now Twilley was thoughtful, and (not to repeat)</div>
<div class="verse">Though very good-natured, was also discreet;</div>
<div class="verse">He cautioned the men not to drink more than needed,</div>
<div class="verse">And, of course, he had felt his advice would be heeded,</div>
<div class="verse">But the men were but men, and the most were mere boys,</div>
<div class="verse">At that uncertain age called the &#8220;hobble-de-hoys,&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Unused to the wine, or the shame that it brings,</div>
<div class="verse">And quite self-important, but (innocent things)</div>
<div class="verse">How could they when older become very sage</div>
<div class="verse">If they hadn&#8217;t learned something at that early age?</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
<div class="verse">The flood was declining at noon-time that day,</div>
<div class="verse">And danger seemed held in abeyance away.</div>
<div class="verse">The clouds rolled away, and the afternoon sun</div>
<div class="verse">Looked down with a smile that was brim-full of fun.</div>
<div class="verse">The dancers held councils and hoped for the best</div>
<div class="verse">Till all were more tranquil and much less distressed,</div>
<div class="verse">And as most of the dancers were youthful in years,</div>
<div class="verse">And none had grown old in their hearts, so their fears</div>
<div class="verse">Were more transient to them than to those who were older,</div>
<div class="verse">While their daring, as well as their folly, was bolder.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Day waned into night, and with no sign of rain,</div>
<div class="verse">They had dreaded the night, but the moon shone again</div>
<div class="verse">And that seemed the signal that none were to die,</div>
<div class="verse">So they sat down to eat with the table banked high,</div>
<div class="verse">And glad with the thought of the waters declining,</div>
<div class="verse">They forgot all their trials and soon began dining,</div>
<div class="verse">And all of them dallied a little with wine</div>
<div class="verse">(To get up a courage) and some feeling fine</div>
<div class="verse">Sprang up with a song and went dancing around</div>
<div class="verse">All over the house on the acre of ground.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
<div class="verse">&#8217;Twas as if they had suddenly lost all their fears,</div>
<div class="verse">Or had burst into laughter while still in their tears.</div>
<div class="verse">They capered and romped in a strange childish glee,</div>
<div class="verse">While Malindy was singing hilariously.</div>
<div class="verse">The chaperone scolded and coaxed them in vain</div>
<div class="verse">To heed what she said, and be decent and sane;</div>
<div class="verse">To remember their danger and think of poor Dan;</div>
<div class="verse">She cried and she screamed, but they every one ran</div>
<div class="verse">And left their hen-mamma so anxious and fond,</div>
<div class="verse">Like so many gosling, to swim in the pond.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And what though the fiddlers felt sleepy and droned</div>
<div class="verse">Or even the fiddles went harsh and untoned,</div>
<div class="verse">So long as the drum was sufficiently jarred,</div>
<div class="verse">The dance was too maudlin to feel the discord,</div>
<div class="verse">The witling went whirling in ancient ghwazee,</div>
<div class="verse">But just what to call it no two could agree.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;A damsel once danced it,&#8221; the great witling said,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;When her sweet mamma wanted the great Baptist&#8217;s head.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">If he meant to be gruesome, they said he was shallow,</div>
<div class="verse">And as none would dance with him he danced with his shadow.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
<div class="verse">The bold Roland Rare was possessed with a swagger</div>
<div class="verse">That had all the grace of a common blind stagger,</div>
<div class="verse">While Simon, the cynic, looked on with a sneer,</div>
<div class="verse">And every time Roland passed grinned with a leer.</div>
<div class="verse">The folly went on as it had gone before,</div>
<div class="verse">Till some growing thoughtful, refused to dance more;</div>
<div class="verse">Then directly most every one seemed of like thought,</div>
<div class="verse">For the wine was all gone, and the ones who had sought</div>
<div class="verse">The wine cup the most, had a look as if taunted</div>
<div class="verse">By more than the fear with which others were haunted.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">For the pleasure from wine turned to mockery soon,</div>
<div class="verse">And the sweetest song then had remorse in its tone.</div>
<div class="verse">When the spirit they found in the cup that was brought</div>
<div class="verse">Turned a weakling and died and their nerves were distraught.</div>
<div class="verse">Then their folly to them seemed as dark as a crime</div>
<div class="verse">Which could never be whitened by penance or time&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Crash! ev&#8217;rywhere out of doors, crash and splash!</div>
<div class="verse">The drift-wood and water and yellow waves dash.</div>
<div class="verse">And in the room there all the women are crying,</div>
<div class="verse">While all the men suffer a weakness as trying.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
<div class="verse">For their nerves were so racked by the roar of the river</div>
<div class="verse">That the men felt their danger more keenly than ever;</div>
<div class="verse">But one told a story and some tried to smile</div>
<div class="verse">With efforts to rally the others the while</div>
<div class="verse">From cowardly fearing; then some fell asleep</div>
<div class="verse">To awake with a start and upon the floor leap;</div>
<div class="verse">But Simon, the cynic, still looked with a sneer,</div>
<div class="verse">And ev&#8217;ry time Roland waked, grinned with a leer;</div>
<div class="verse">And assuming his swagger with impudent mocking,</div>
<div class="verse">He sang with a ribaldry meant to be shocking.</div>
</div></div></div>


<h3>SIMON&#8217;S SONG</h3>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Arrayed in fine linen, we go to a ball,</div>
<div class="indent">Where we banquet with friends whom we joyously meet,</div>
<div class="verse">And we revel down wine and the savories all</div>
<div class="indent">Mid flowers and the music so lang&#8217;rously sweet;</div>
<div class="verse">But anon, while we linger the banqueting sours</div>
<div class="verse">In these bothersome bodies of ours.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
<div class="verse">Then in stupor we sleep while our spirits take flight</div>
<div class="indent">To places unknown in a wondering dream,</div>
<div class="verse">And we fall from a tower in a horrible fright,</div>
<div class="indent">Where we strangle and drown in a deep-rolling stream;</div>
<div class="verse">For our spirits may soar all alone to high towers,</div>
<div class="verse">But they fall with these bodies of ours.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">We have faith and a hope and some charity, too,</div>
<div class="indent">We trust in our preacher, or elder, or pope,</div>

<div class="verse">Still, &#8217;tis hard to stay drowned very long in a dream</div>

<div class="indent">To awake in a cold, clammy sweat, and we find</div>

<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
<div class="verse">He sang it as though it o&#8217;erflowed with his wit,</div>
<div class="verse">And the dancers were glad when he got through with it.</div>
<div class="verse">Even danger no longer could keep them from sleep,</div>
<div class="verse">Which was fitful to some, whilst to others &#8217;twas deep,</div>
<div class="verse">But they left not the room where in circles they grouped,</div>
<div class="verse">Or they lounged in the chairs, as when sleeping they drooped.</div>
<div class="verse">They were tired, Oh! so tired, and with all so distressed,</div>
<div class="verse">They slept in discomfort, but tried to find rest,</div>
<div class="verse">When suddenly every one woke with a fear&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">A storm was approaching, they felt it was near.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">They heard the wind moaning among the tall trees,</div>
<div class="verse">Then louder and swift sprang the shrill eastern breeze,</div>
<div class="verse">Until the house shook from the force of its sway,</div>
<div class="verse">And they felt the trees bend as their shadows would play;</div>
<div class="verse">Then the rain began falling, though lightly at first,</div>
<div class="verse">Till directly it seemed like a sweeping cloud-burst;</div>
<div class="verse">When a flash of sharp lightning had blinded the room,</div>
<div class="verse">A terrific loud peal like a great cannon&#8217;s boom</div>
<div class="verse">Came thundering above them with crashing resound</div>
<div class="verse">That made the house quake on the acre of ground.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
<div class="verse">Then to every one came an alarm for their daring</div>
<div class="verse">And folly. In silence, with awe in their bearing,</div>
<div class="verse">They tiptoed to look out of window and door,</div>
<div class="verse">Then out in the darkness and in the down-pour</div>
<div class="verse">Of the rain to the edge of the water they wandered.</div>
<div class="verse">The river was rising! They shivered and pondered,</div>
<div class="verse">And they peered through the gloom for help that might come,</div>
<div class="verse">But it came not! it came not! They turned to the home</div>
<div class="verse">Through the darkness of night and the chill of the air,</div>
<div class="verse">They groped to the house in an utter despair.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">A cry of distress from without reached their ears,</div>
<div class="verse">Then louder it grew, and with strange, haunting fears,</div>
<div class="verse">They trembled and listened to hear it again,</div>
<div class="verse">When above the loud roar and the storm and the rain,</div>
<div class="verse">Like a wail of the lost came the heart-rending cry.</div>
<div class="verse">Some fainted; some stood with a wide-staring eye</div>
<div class="verse">And ran from the room on a rescue to start,</div>
<div class="verse">Whilst others sprang up with a fast beating heart,</div>
<div class="verse">When the crying grew faint, like a nightmare it pass&#8217;d,</div>
<div class="verse">But it left with the dancers the shadow it cast.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
<div class="verse">The storm was abating, the rainfall had ceased,</div>
<div class="verse">The terrible roar for a time had decreased,</div>
<div class="verse">The dancers were thoughtful and quiet at last,</div>
<div class="verse">And hopeful, perhaps, that the worst had now passed,</div>
<div class="verse">When, horrors! Again came a cry of despair,</div>
<div class="verse">Then louder and longer it hung in the air;</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Oh, some one is drowning,&#8221; they screamed as they flew</div>
<div class="verse">Through the hall and the doorway&mdash;so sure it was true&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">And there in the darkness, with no moon to see by,</div>
<div class="verse">They found the hound howling most piteously.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">That ominous sound was to them the death token;</div>
<div class="verse">They returned to the house, and without a word spoken</div>
<div class="verse">(Their feelings too awed for a word or a tear),</div>
<div class="verse">To sit there in silence and tremble in fear,</div>
<div class="verse">Till some one spoke softly of Dan and his fate;</div>
<div class="verse">Then Malindy grew nervous&mdash;the strain was too great&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">She rose to her feet with an uncertain totter,</div>
<div class="verse">And weaving around till the bachelor caught her,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;How awful!&#8221; she sighed, as she fell in a swoon,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;To hear a hound howling without any moon!&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
<div class="verse">There then was confusion&mdash;the table knocked over</div>
<div class="verse">And likewise the chairs&mdash;but the bachelor lover</div>
<div class="verse">Held fast to Malindy, as all lovers should;</div>
<div class="verse">Malindy lay quiet&mdash;but that&#8217;s understood&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">The witling ran errands and acted real nice,</div>
<div class="verse">While Neoma was rubbing, and all gave advice,</div>
<div class="verse">Or all save the Cynic, who grinned &#8217;round the place,</div>
<div class="verse">Till Malindy came to, when she hid her sweet face</div>
<div class="verse">In the bachelor&#8217;s arms, where they left her alone,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Come away,&#8221; cried the Cynic, &#8220;at last she is won.&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">There was no more dancing throughout the dark night,</div>
<div class="verse">So intently they longed for the coming of light,</div>
<div class="verse">For danger and darkness are frightfully mated</div>
<div class="verse">When danger approaches where darkness has waited.</div>
<div class="verse">They heard the wild river loud laughing and jeering!</div>
<div class="verse">It mocked at their fears while it ever was nearing;</div>
<div class="verse">Then they huddled in groups, as do creatures when caged,</div>
<div class="verse">When they heard the mad monster that roared and raged&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">He was coming, was coming, they knew by the sound,</div>
<div class="verse">He would sweep the house off of the acre of ground.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
<div class="verse">At daybreak the water was high in the barn.</div>
<div class="verse">They moved all the horses and cattle and corn</div>
<div class="verse">Near the house, and there likewise they stacked up the hay.</div>
<div class="verse">Thus the morning hours passed with forebodings away,</div>
<div class="verse">With many reproaches and bitter complaints,</div>
<div class="verse">That none came to rescue&mdash;and two or three faints.</div>
<div class="verse">If in darkness they&#8217;d longed for the coming of light,</div>
<div class="verse">(While regretting their folly, they&#8217;d thought of their plight),</div>
<div class="verse">Still the danger seemed greater that noon-day had brought,</div>
<div class="verse">As even that came with a new peril fraught.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">For the river still rose and the horses and cattle</div>
<div class="verse">Stood in water to knees; &#8217;twas in earnest a battle</div>
<div class="verse">For life, for the whole of the great bulk of hay</div>
<div class="verse">That the dancers had stacked had now floated away,</div>
<div class="verse">And the corn had all gone, leaving nothing to eat&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">It was hard for the cattle to stand on their feet.</div>
<div class="verse">Some one cried, &#8220;O! look yonder&mdash;the barn is afloat!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">And sullen and black like a water-soaked boat,</div>
<div class="verse">They saw it sink low to its roof in the tide</div>
<div class="verse">Where the great hound had clambered in safety to ride.</div>

<div class="verse">They saw them pass out of the windows below,</div>
<div class="verse">Both single and double they filed in a row</div>

<div class="verse">And if they were hungry, they thought not of that;</div>
<div class="verse">If they wanted for sleep, still, they wide-awake sat.</div>
<div class="verse">They feared that some madness would seize them while there,</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The threats of the weak brought alarm to the stronger,</div>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">They were dumb. Not a soul but had ceased to complain;</div>
<div class="verse">They felt they were doomed, and to struggle was vain.</div>
<div class="verse">Some covered their faces and muffled their ears;</div>
<div class="verse">Some trembled and shook as with palsy from fears.</div>
<div class="verse">Like children they clung to each other and waited</div>

<div class="verse">The &#8220;Oracle&#8221; suddenly came to life, too,</div>
<div class="verse">As often &#8217;tis found where there&#8217;s hope people do;</div>
<div class="verse">He shouted and waved with the wildest delight,</div>
<div class="verse">When the recognized forms of his friends came in sight.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">He cried, &#8220;Oh, we&#8217;ve all had a lark of a time!</div>
<div class="verse">We&#8217;ve been up to Twilley&#8217;s to dance to my rhyme,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
<div class="verse">And water-bound there since we left the old town,</div>
<div class="verse">We have danced day and night, and the most the way down;</div>
<div class="verse">We grew tired of the place, and we thought we&#8217;d come home.</div>
<div class="verse">All the dancers are with us&mdash;they wanted to come.</div>
<div class="verse">As the stream was rough swimming and too deep to wade,</div>
<div class="verse">We concluded to come on the trip the house made.</div>
<div class="verse">How&#8217;s the folks at Dinwiddie? There&#8217;s no use to worry,</div>
<div class="verse">The flood will subside when it gets o&#8217;er its flurry.&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Though the moments had seemed to the dancers so frightened,</div>
<div class="verse">Like so many hours, yet their hearts were so lightened</div>
<div class="verse">With hope, that they took the bed-slats and rowed on</div>
<div class="verse">With a strange, nervous strength that seemed hardly their own,</div>
<div class="verse">After all of the trials through which they had gone,</div>
<div class="verse">And the dauntless bass-fiddler rowed swiftly the &#8220;John,&#8221;</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
<div class="verse">To help them to land near the dancers&#8217; own town,</div>
<div class="verse">Where some cried, and some danced with the crowds that came down,</div>
<div class="verse">And many gave thanks with a quivering lip&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">They were safe! They were safe! from the perilous trip.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">There the house that the dancers had come in was moored,</div>
<div class="verse">Where the tale of its marvelous venture still lured</div>
<div class="verse">The thousands long after the flood had declined,</div>
<div class="verse">Till piece-meal from vandals and weather combined,</div>
<div class="verse">It fell to decay, or was carried away.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8217;Twas a favorite pastime on any fine day</div>
<div class="verse">For the thoughtless to waltz through the house with a song</div>
<div class="verse">And leaving to carry a relic along,</div>
<div class="verse">Until nothing was left of the house that withstood</div>
<div class="verse">The perils that came with the eighty-four flood.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The tall trees are standing, still standing alone,</div>
<div class="verse">Where they whisper each other the nights they have known,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
<div class="verse">And if they seem lonely without the old house,</div>
<div class="verse">Yet the birds in the evenings go there to carouse.</div>
<div class="verse">There they chatter and sing in their merriest lay,</div>
<div class="verse">And, like dancers, choose partners in much the same way;</div>
<div class="verse">And the boatmen will tell how they sometimes have heard</div>
<div class="verse">There the singing of songs&mdash;not the notes of a bird&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">As though festive, gay spirits still hovered around,</div>
<div class="verse">Late, late in the night on the acre of ground.</div>
